Thanks, guys, keep it up!"* ~ [exonfluxx](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-plugin-great-support-389?replies=2#post-)

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
*"Hammering out issues with most plugin teams usually takes at least 24 hours. For more complicated support issues, it can take a handful of days to fix a problem. The time between messages with the Feed Them Social support team was around 15 minutes instead of 15 hours. Fantastic."* ~ [tunare](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/freaky-fast-support?replies=2#post-)
